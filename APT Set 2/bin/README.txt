Parker Pearson (jpp20)

Hours Spent:15

Consulted With: Daniel McDonald and Various TA's during office hours on January 28 and January 29.

Resources Used: Java API and Stack Overflow

Answer to Questions: None
 
 Impressions: Thesaurus was the hardest of the programs for me. The already laid out methods made it confusing
 for me to debug. Also, it was the first program that really involved arrayLists. I think the first program
 of the apt should be a very simple program with incomplete methods based upon using arrayLists. I think this
 would ease the transition a bit.
